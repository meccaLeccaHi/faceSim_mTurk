**face_sim.html** is an experimental psychology experiment using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** (with **jQuery**).
Faces are presented in randomized order as pairs, and the subject is instructed to rate their similarity.
 
Developed largely using the examples provided by [*Mechanical Turk tutorial*](https://bradylab.ucsd.edu/ttt/) by **Timothy Brady** (UCSD)

**face_dsm.py** is a analysis script using **Python**.
Responses of mTurk workers are shown first in their raw form [],<br>
then in the form of a similarity matrix [],
and finally following classical multidimensional scaling<sup>1</sup> [].
