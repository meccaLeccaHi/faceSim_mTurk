######

-**face_sim.html** is an experimental psychology experiment using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** (with **jQuery**)<sup>1</sup>.
Faces are presented in randomized order as pairs, and the subject is instructed to rate their similarity.
 
-**face_dsm.py** is a **Python** analysis script.
Responses of mTurk workers are shown first in their raw form (<i>left panel</i>),
then in the form of a similarity matrix (<i>middle panel</i>),
and finally following classical multidimensional scaling<sup>2</sup> (<i>right panel</i>). <br> <br>
